# ionic-router-issue
Issue with Ionic Router 6.x working correctly from a Vanilla JS Lit web component (App-Root)

ion-router, ion-router-outlet, ion-nav, ion-tab work as expected when use from index.html, but fail or don't work as expected from a web component "app-root"

see [Issue #26115](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/26115)
